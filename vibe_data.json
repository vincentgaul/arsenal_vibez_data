{"hourly": {"vibe_word": "Hopeful", "vibe_score": 8, "summary": "Arsenal fans are riding a wave of cautious optimism, with passionate declarations about winning the league ('120% sure!'), tactical debates about midfield combinations, and dark humor about Jesus' form being 'lacklustre' enough for Arteta to drop him. The vibe is hopeful with a side of 'don't jinx it' energy."}, "daily": {"vibe_word": "Cautious", "vibe_score": 7, "summary": "Arsenal fans exhibit cautious optimism throughout the day, buoyed by their league lead and statistical title probabilities (90-97%), but this is consistently undercut by anxiety over past collapses, injuries, and decisive fixtures against Man City and Liverpool. Sentiment shifts slightly from hopefulness to heightened tension as the day progresses, with fatigue concerns and 'It\u2019s the hope that kills you' mentality tempering euphoria. Humor and schadenfreude serve as coping mechanisms, yet the overall trend remains one of guarded hope."}, "weekly": {"vibe_word": "Optimistic", "vibe_score": 7, "summary": "The week began with cautious optimism, surged to euphoric confidence after Arsenal's decisive 3-0 victory extended their league lead, and settled into tempered optimism as rival results injected late-week anxiety. While persistent concerns over injuries, rival pressure, and historical skepticism created volatility, resilient bullishness about the title race and pride in Arteta's tactics dominated the overall trend. Sentiment consistently trended positive but remained guarded, with emotional highs punctuated by neurotic undertones."}}
